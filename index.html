        <h1>Marshmallow</h1>

<p>I'm writing my own Campfire client. Here it is.</p>

<h2>Introducing...</h2>

<p>It's a lofty list but here's what it'll eventually support:</p>

<ul>
<li>37signals OAuth2 implementation</li>
<li>Multiple Campfire accounts</li>
<li>Any kind of file uploads</li>
<li>Universal binary</li>
</ul><p>The "duh" list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple rooms</li>
<li>User lists</li>
<li>Transcripts</li>
<li>Image uploads</li>
</ul><p>And the one thing it won't support (at least for a super long time):</p>

<ul>
<li>Push notifications</li>
</ul><p>Seriously, that one is kind of a big deal, but it would require moving all this processing to a server that constantly listens to thousands of rooms and I don't have that kind of money or patience.</p>

<p>Speaking of money, it's gonna be a free app, with an in-app upgrade to pro. The pro upgrade will unlock fancy things like transcript search, any-kind-of-file uploads, and maybe a few other badass features I can think of. But since it's my first major own-released app, I want to make a majority of the features free to spur interest.</p>

<h2>In the open</h2>

<p>That brings me to my next point. To spur more interest and to earn myself some serious nerd cred, I'm developing this baby as open-source. Seriously, if you're a developer, you're always free to download the source code and deploy it to your own devices using Xcode. <strong>If you're interested in doing so, <a href="https://github.com/kreeger/marshmallow/blob/master/development.markdown">read the development guide</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, I'm making my <a href="https://trello.com/board/marshmallow/514fbcd0177fbc7739000041">Trello board public</a> so you can comment and vote on features and implementation stuff. Commenting is locked for now, but once I get closer to publishing betas, I'll open it up for the world.</p>
